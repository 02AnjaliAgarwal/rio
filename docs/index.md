## Why Rio?

Rio is built over WebGPU, WebAssembly and Rust. The WebGPU API makes it suitable for general purpose graphics and compute on the GPU.

Applications using WPGU run natively on Vulkan, Metal, DirectX 11/12, and OpenGL ES; and browsers via WebAssembly on WebGPU and WebGL2.

## Is it ready?

Not yet, but you can download an [unstable version for MacOS](/rio/download) (x86 and arm64).

## Development status?

You can follow [@raphamorims](https://twitter.com/raphamorims) on Twitter to track Rio development updates.
