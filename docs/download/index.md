## Download

You can download Rio terminal for macOS platform, although is not stable and lacking features since the development of a beta release version is still in process.

New versions are created by weekly and monthly basis, so if you are using an unstable version make sure to keep updated.

- [Download macOS - x86 v0.0.5-rc2 (unstable)](https://github.com/raphamorim/rio/releases/download/v0.0.5-rc2/macos-x86.zip)
- [Download macOS - arm64 v0.0.5-rc2 (unstable)](https://github.com/raphamorim/rio/releases/download/v0.0.5-rc2/macos-arm64.zip)

Rio application is not notarized yet, so in case runs into any problem when opening it:

{% highlight toml %}
xattr -d com.apple.quarantine <path-to-rio-app>
{% endhighlight %}
