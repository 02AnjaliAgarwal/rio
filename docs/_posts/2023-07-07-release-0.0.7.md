# Config reload, Windows support

Rio release 0.0.7 is finally here, there's a lot of updates to cover so let's get started. I also would like to remind you that Rio is still unstable. This release adds a lot of bug fixes and feature additions in order to make Rio terminal stable.

## Reload automatically when the configuration file has changed.

Any file update in the configuration file will trigger a render operation in Rio terminal with the new configuration.

If you have any suggestion of configuration ideas to Rio, please feel free to [open an issue](https://github.com/raphamorim/rio/issues/new).

The property witdh and height doesn't work anymore after the 0.0.7 release.
